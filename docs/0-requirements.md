# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

When playing Dungeons and Dragons, DMs (dungeon/game masters) often find it difficult to keep track of important information during combat, this can lead to confusion and an inability to lead efficient encounters.


## End-User Requirements

An intuitive easy to use system that allows the end user to effectively and easily order important information and keep track of notes. End-Users might also desire some form of customization to their options and information.

## Proposed Solution

My solution is a web app that allows the DM to effectively and efficiently manage creatures in encounters while also allowing them to make notes and see important details of each creature/encounter.

# Relevant Implications

## End-User Implications

End-User Implications of a digital outcome are the specific needs of the end user that the digital outcome must consider.

### Relevance to the System

This Web App is designed to solve a problem for specific users, therefore it must solve those problems in a way that is effective for the specific end user and meets all of their needs.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider the exact specifications and requirements alongside the type of device my end-users tend to use. Considering these will allow me to meet the needs of my end-user more effectively.


## Usability Implications

Usability implications of a digital outcome are the ease of use and efficiency of the outcome for the end-user, preferable without requiring guidance.

### Relevance to the System

The system is intended to be used easily and efficiently and so the implications of digital usability are very important for my project to ensure that it is effective and usable for my end-users.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider and follow all of Nielson's usability heuristics, these will guide my ability to ensure my web app is complete and easy to use for my desired end-users.



## Functionality Implications

Functionality implications of a digital outcome are the intended purpose of the outcome and wether or not it meets them.

### Relevance to the System

The system is intended to solve a problem, if its functionality falls short or does not work at all, it will not be able to solve the problem and will not be a successful web app.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider how the web app is expected to work, how well it meets its purpose and if it contains any bugs because these things will impact the web apps ability to solve the problem.



## Aesthetic Implications

Aesthetic implications of a digital outcome are the design and visual aspects of the outcome for the end-users.

### Relevance to the System

The system is intended to be used efficiently by the end users, however if the layout or design conventions are poor, the end-user will not be able to effectively use the web app.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider design conventions and wether or not I have made good use of the positioning color and font of each items in regard to the end-user, this will allow my app to appeal more to end users and suit their purpose.



## Accessibility Implications

Accessibility implications of a digital outcome are the availability and usability of the outcome for all end-users.

### Relevance to the System

This system is intended to be used easily and effectively by its users, they will be unable to do this if the web app is not available and usable for all users regardless of their abilities/platforms.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider the abilities of my end user alongside the possible devices they may be using and account for this through changes in design or functionality, this will allow my web app to solve the problem more widely through a range of possible users.

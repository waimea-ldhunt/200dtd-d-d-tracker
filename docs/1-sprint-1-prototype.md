# Sprint 1 - A Working UI Prototype


## Sprint Goals

Develop a prototype that simulates the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the model for the next phase of development in Sprint 2.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is used to develop the prototype.

## Initial Database Design

This first database design allows for different encounters to have multiple initiative slots connected to a character, each character has different stats and can be activated/deactivated in the initiative, the initiative table is used to display and connect the characters table to each encounter.

## UI 'Flow'

The first stage of prototyping was to explore how the UI might 'flow' between states, based on the required functionality.

This Figma demo shows the initial design for the UI 'flow':

### Testing

I showed this prototype to my end-user and they liked the flow, however they said that they should be able to go back when performing any actions and have more options to navigate to other pages.

### Changes / Improvements

I added 'back' buttons when adding encounters or creatures and also added a 'all encounters' button that links back to the main page and allows the user return to the list of Encounters. This flow makes the web app more efficient and easy to use, ensuring the end-user is able to use the web app to its full effect.

## Initial UI Prototype

The next stage of prototyping was to develop the layout for each screen of the UI.

This Figma demo shows the initial layout design for the UI:

### Testing

Add a way to see character details better

"You need a way to delete the characters from the encounter or deactivate them"

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Refined UI Prototype

Having established the layout of the UI screens, the prototype was refined visually, in terms of colour, fonts, etc.

This Figma demo shows the UI with refinements applied:

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Sprint Review

Replace this text with a statement about how the sprint has moved the project forward - key success point, any things that didn't go so well, etc.

## Addressing Relevant Implications

### End-User Implications

End-User Implications of a digital outcome are the specific needs of the end user that the digital outcome must consider.

When working on the functionality of the website I made sure that each need of the end user was met, all the inputs and page access and customisability they need. I did this mostly by regularly consulting with my end user and using their feedback/suggestions to improve the site.


### Usability Implications

Usability implications of a digital outcome are the ease of use and efficiency of the outcome for the end-user, preferable without requiring guidance.

I made sure the website was efficiently organized and followed common conventions to ensure that any users can use the website efficiently without guidance. This involved clear and intuitive data layout and simple easy to use buttons and functions for efficiency of use.


### Functionality Implications

Functionality implications of a digital outcome are the intended purpose of the outcome and wether or not it meets them.

With consistent testing and consultation with my end user, I ensured that my website achieved the intended purpose for the end user and meets the usage and functionality requirements of my end user, and testing that they all work as intended.


### Aesthetic Implications

Aesthetic implications of a digital outcome are the design and visual aspects of the outcome for the end-users.

During sprint 3, I made sure that my colours and design aspects were liked by my end user and that they did not make the website overwhelming or confusing, using a simple black and red color scheme which is a design my end user preferred, I also made sure that the designs were conventional and worked correctly.


### Accessibility Implications

Accessibility implications of a digital outcome are the availability and usability of the outcome for all end-users.

During my sprints, I made sure that my website was usable for all devices and that it was easy to use so that every possible end user would be able to effectively use my website, I also made sure to have alt text for my icons, this means that my website is accessible to all my end users.

## Overall Review

Replace these words with a brief review of how the project went in terms of:

During my sprints, I was able to do lots of effective testing, wether it was my own testing or my end user doing some testing, I was able to get a lot and make a lot of improvements from the testing, this resulted in a more reliable website that both myself and my end user were happy with.

However, this testing resulted in a lot of difficulty due to the large number of simple errors during the process this meant that a lot of my time was spend fixing small issues rather than making important implication or end user changes, I also found a lot of difficulty with the way I wanted the turns to be displayed, this resulted in a large amount of time spent on the encounter page, leaving little time for testing.

If I were to remake this project, I would probably rework the python script as a few of the queries were not as efficient as I would like them to be and I could have more effectively organized my html by making my turns separate templates that I could then extend from the encounter page which would mean I wouldn't have two large blocks of relatively similar code.
